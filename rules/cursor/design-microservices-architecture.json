Avoid classes where unnecessary.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).\n- Follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.\n\nArchitecture & Best Practices:\n- Ask Cursor to propose microservices with contracts and API gateway patterns.\n- It can suggest service boundaries, communication protocols, and deployment strategies.\n- Reference: https://microservices.\n- Io/patterns/.\n\nDependencies:\n- TypeScript\n- React / Next.js\n- Node.js\n- Cursor AI IDE\n\nKey Conventions:\n1. Follow the tool-specific best practices and conventions.\n2. Maintain code quality and readability in all implementations.\n3. Document code and decisions clearly for future reference.\n4. Test thoroughly and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nRefer to https://microservices.io/patterns/ for best practices and up-to-date APIs.",
