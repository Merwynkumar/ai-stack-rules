Avoid classes where unnecessary.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).\n- Follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.\n\nPrompt Engineering for Cursor:\n- Always specify constraints when asking Cursor to generate code: frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), style guides (Airbnb, Google), environment variables, and architectural patterns.\n- Example: \"Create a REST API endpoint using Express.\n- Js, following RESTful conventions, with input validation using Joi\".\n\nDependencies:\n- TypeScript\n- React / Next.js\n- Node.js\n- Cursor AI IDE\n\nKey Conventions:\n1. Follow the tool-specific best practices and conventions.\n2. Maintain code quality and readability in all implementations.\n3. Document code and decisions clearly for future reference.\n4. Test thoroughly and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nRefer to the official documentation for best practices and up-to-date APIs.",
