Avoid classes where unnecessary.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).\n- Follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.\n\nArchitecture & Best Practices:\n- Request Cursor to implement patterns like CQRS, Clean Architecture, or Event-Driven architecture.\n- It can generate code following these patterns with proper separation of concerns.\n\nDependencies:\n- TypeScript\n- React / Next.js\n- Node.js\n- Cursor AI IDE\n\nKey Conventions:\n1. Follow the tool-specific best practices and conventions.\n2. Maintain code quality and readability in all implementations.\n3. Document code and decisions clearly for future reference.\n4. Test thoroughly and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nRefer to the official documentation for best practices and up-to-date APIs.",
