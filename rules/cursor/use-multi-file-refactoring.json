Avoid classes where unnecessary.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).\n- Follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.\n\nPrompt Engineering for Cursor:\n- For project-wide changes, use \"Apply this across the project\" feature instead of single-file edits.\n- This ensures consistency and saves time.\n- Cursor can refactor patterns across multiple files simultaneously.\n- Learn more: https://docs.\n- Cursor.\n- Com/features/multi-file-edits.\n\nDependencies:\n- TypeScript\n- React / Next.js\n- Node.js\n- Cursor AI IDE\n\nKey Conventions:\n1. Follow the tool-specific best practices and conventions.\n2. Maintain code quality and readability in all implementations.\n3. Document code and decisions clearly for future reference.\n4. Test thoroughly and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nRefer to https://docs.cursor.com/features/multi-file-edits for best practices and up-to-date APIs.",
