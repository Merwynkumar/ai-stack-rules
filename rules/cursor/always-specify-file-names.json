Avoid classes where unnecessary.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).\n- Follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.\n\nPrompt Engineering for Cursor:\n- When asking Cursor to edit or create files, always include the exact file path and name.\n- This prevents ambiguity and ensures Cursor modifies the correct file.\n- Example: \"Update the authentication logic in src/auth/login.\n- Ts\" instead of \"Update the login function\".\n- Reference: https://docs.\n- Cursor.\n- Com/usage/editing.\n\nDependencies:\n- TypeScript\n- React / Next.js\n- Node.js\n- Cursor AI IDE\n\nKey Conventions:\n1. Follow the tool-specific best practices and conventions.\n2. Maintain code quality and readability in all implementations.\n3. Document code and decisions clearly for future reference.\n4. Test thoroughly and handle edge cases appropriately.\n\nRefer to https://docs.cursor.com/usage/editing for best practices and up-to-date APIs.",
